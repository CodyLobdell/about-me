    <p>
      Hello my name is Mikal Johnson! Im born and raised in a small town in Florida call South Bay, and ive moved up in 2017 for military reasons. 
      While in the military i was working in the medical field as a Patient Admin Specialist. Including that and a couple IT courses and Python, 
      SQL, Java, and C# courses, that pretty much wraps up my education portion of my life. I usually make 3 short terms goals that are directly 
      going towards my long terms goals. I also dabble in real estate now, hopefully i can make it a thing in the near future.
    </p>
